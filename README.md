Fortune favors the bold
I write this in a time where I find myself eager for change. No longer will I stagnate in the world I find myself in. I will commit to web development as a means of expressing my life's adventures for the benifit of others to live their best lives. It was during my spontaneous trip to Ashville I heard the phrase "fortune favors the bold." I will be bold in my conquest for change so that I may experience life as it was intended to be, free.
